  "about": [
    "This app is a digital Umrah and Hajj guide developed based on the guidebook Menyahut Seruan Ilahi. It is designed to accompany pilgrims through the main rituals of Umrah, whether they are following a mutawwif or performing Umrah on their own.",
    "It is intended to complement formal Hajj and Umrah classes, serving as a practical reference during the journey itself. It is not meant to replace structured learning and pilgrims are encouraged to first learn and understand the rites of Hajj and Umrah through classes from qualified teachers before relying on this app as a companion during their pilgrimage.",
    "Our aim is to provide an authentic and reliable reference that is accessible to all pilgrims performing Hajj and Umrah, so that they may carry out their manasik (rites) with greater clarity and peace of mind. With Allah’s permission, we hope this app becomes a means of ease throughout this noble and sacred journey.",
    "May this app also be a lasting source of reward and ongoing charity for everyone who has contributed their efforts to it in any way, and especially for the late founder, Allahyarhamah Halijah Binte Abdul Hamid Almunawwarah, the founder of Halijah Travel, whose love for innovation and dedication to finding new ways to support pilgrims continue to inspire this work."
